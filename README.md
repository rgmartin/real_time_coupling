## Neutronic - thermal coupling in a real-time nuclear reactor simulator. (2017)

[Final report](https://github.com/rgmartin/real_time_coupling/blob/main/Documentaci%C3%B3n/ClassicThesis.pdf)

This work presents the characterization and analysis of calculation neutronic library PUMITA, aimed to model the neutronic behavior of nuclear reactor CAREM-25
core. This library will be coupled to the plant analysis code RELAP as the nuclear
reactor core model for the Graphical Interactive Simulator aimed at training the
future operators of CAREM-25. Thereby is essential for a thorough characterization of the library, to include studies and characterization of the abovementioned
coupling as well
